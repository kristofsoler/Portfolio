							<h1>Understanding the Socio-Economic Dynamics of Political Affiliation in Norway Using SHAP: Insights from European Social Survey 10</h1>
							<div style="text-align: center;">

								<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #333;">The above tables show the output variable scale and the top 8 features that were identified using SHAP.</p>
							  </div>
							<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
							<p>This project investigates the socio-economic factors influencing political affiliation in Norway, using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) 10. The study employs machine learning models, with the XGBoost regressor achieving the best performance in predicting political leaning on a 0–10 left-right scale. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), the analysis reveals key features driving political attitudes, including income inequality, immigration, and opinions on European Union unification</p>
							<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
							<p>
								The project used Python for data preprocessing, model training, and interpretability analysis. Missing data in the ESS dataset was handled using bootstrapping, which resampled available data to preserve dataset integrity and ensure robust analysis. To standardize the data, a StandardScaler was applied, transforming categorical variables onto consistent scales suitable for machine learning algorithms. Non-parametric models were chosen due to the lack of Gaussian distribution in categorical data, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
								
								Several machine learning models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost, were trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R². Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search with cross-validation, ensuring the optimal configuration of the models. The XGBoost regressor outperformed others, demonstrating lower MSE and higher R² values on both training and testing datasets.</p>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
							<p>The findings highlight that left-leaning voters prioritize reducing income inequality and supporting immigration, while right-leaning voters oppose income redistribution and prefer limited immigration. Interestingly, enthusiasm for European Union unification aligns more with right-wing voters, contrary to broader trends. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of the socio-economic factors shaping political polarization in Norway.

										  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #333;">Above figure shows the most important features at the top. The question of reducing income differences has the most impact on the model. The red colour indicates the value for that feature has a higher positive value on that scale.  For the question of reducing income difference, the red colour means the respondent disagrees. The X axis tells us if it has a positive or negative effect on the output scale. In this case respondents that are more right leaning disagree with reducing income differences.</p>

										<figcaption style="font-size: 18px; color: #333;">Above figure shows a force plot of a random participant with a predicted 7.07 on the output scale (RIGHT leaning). The features here in favour of pushing this participant right is a disagreement that income differences should be minimised, not at all worried about climate change</figcaption>
										<figure style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
											<img src="images_social/force1.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width: 700px; height: auto;">
											<figcaption style="font-size: 18px; color: #333;">Above figure shows a force plot of a random participant with a predicted 2.7 on the output scale (LEFT leaning).  The blue features show the magnitude at which it pushes the output lower (being more left on the scale) from the base value (which is the output value without any features). The size of the arrows indicates the extent it has on the output. The features here in favour of pushing this participant left are income differences, climate change being human made, participated in demonstrations and the countries culture is enriched by immigrants.  </figcaption>

							<p>While the XGBoost model performed well, limitations such as moderate model accuracy and the inherent complexity of SHAP interpretations are noted. This study offers valuable insights into political attitudes in Norway</p>
